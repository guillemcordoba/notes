# Siddharta Gautama

- Lived in palace
- Siddharta loses the illusion of modal confusion
- He doesn't belong there anymore
- Morality sits on top of meaningfulness
- Starves himself -> still in having mode
  - Self denial and self-indulgence is having it mode
  - When you negate something, you still frame it in the same way, you don't transcend it
- Middle path is transcendence, not average
- Being mode is about being connected in the right way
- Sati -> to remember a lost mode of being (translation: mindfulness)
- Re-member -> recover your identity in the game

- Siddartha is trying to recover the being mode in the eyes of the mendicant
  - Wants a set of psycotechnologies to do Sati
  - Buddha -> title: the awakaned one

## Mindfulness
- Language of training vs language of explanation
  - Eg. memory by location. Memory is not organized by location
- We should not understand mindfulness in the language of its training
- Mindfulness
  - States that you can regulate
    - Being present
    - Non-judging
  - Traits that you cultivate
    - Insightful
    - Less reactive
- Constituent relationships -> what is part and what is whole?
- Right kind of concentration
  - Soft-vigilance -> renew your interest
    - Not tunneling
    - Constantly exploring and opening up
- Attention
  - Makes things salient
  - Optimizing salience
  - You don't do it directly -> you optimize other things (seeing, hearing)
  - Coordination of different processes
