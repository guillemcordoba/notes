# Shamans

- Means "One who knows"
- Set of [[psycotechnologyies]] for altering your state of consciousness and enhancing cognition
- Practices: sleep depravation, chanting, dancing, imitation, social isolation, psycodelics
- Goal: disrupt the way you find patterns. Think outside the box. Unconsciously we project learnt patterns into situations. This needs to be disrupted to gain insights. 
- The shaman is not gaining beliefs about the deer, he is trying to become the deer -> participary knowing.
- They act as the [[Placebo effect]] of prehistorical times.
