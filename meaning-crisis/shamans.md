# Shamans

- Means "One who knows"
- Set of [[psycotechnologyies]] for altering your state of consciousness and enhancing cognition
- Practices: sleep and sex depravation, chanting, dancing, imitation, social isolation, [[psycodelics]]
- Goal: disrupt the way you find patterns, your frame of reality. Think outside the box. Unconsciously we project learnt patterns into situations. This needs to be disrupted to gain insights. 
- The shaman is not gaining beliefs about the deer, he is trying to become the deer -> participary knowing.
- They act as the [[Placebo effect]] of prehistorical times.
- Getting into the [[Flow state]].
- [[Break the frame]]
- Invention of the [[metaphor]]
- Improving our capacity for sense making and meaning making.
- Groups with a shaman out-compete groups w/o.
