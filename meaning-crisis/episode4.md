# Episode 4

- Pythagoreas:
  - Invents the term [[philosofy]]
- Socrates (many interpretations, this is one of them):
  - Gods represent moral ways in which you can achieve self-transcendence
  - Truth and sacredness are tied together
  - Gods can't lie
  - "Known thy self" is central -> understand how you operate
  - Socratic method -> way of asking questions, deeply bound to how meaningful your life is
  - Interacts with 
    - Natural philosophers 
      - Thales
        - All is the moist -> everything is made out of water (rational claim from the observations of water being the limits and pervades everything)
        - The loadstone has psyche -> forces at work 
        - Everything is filled with gods -> finding out the substance of things provokes a sense of wonder -> that's what sacred is?  
        - Scientific thinking -> Onthological depth perception
      - They give you truth without transformation -> Truth without relevance
    - Sophists
      - Invent rethoric -> pick up skills in language to convince people -> direct democracy 
      - Separated the technology from the moral commitment
      - We are driven by what's salient and important, not what is true -> hyperstimuli
      - Bullshit -> separate salience from truth
        - Lying depends on your commitment on the truth
        - Bullshit works when you don't find important if that's true or not
      - YOU CAN'T LIE TO YOURSELF, BUT YOU CAN BULLSHIT YOURSELF
      - Belief is not a voluntary action
      - You can direct your [[attention]]
  - Socrates wants both 
  - Socratic method makes you fall into Aphoria (when you collapse after too many questions) -> proves that we are bullshitting ourselves, pursuing the salient without understanding it
  - I need to find a way to have importance and truths intertwined
  - Shamanic elements
