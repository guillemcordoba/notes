# Episode 6

- [[Aristotle]]
- Newtonian worldview -> causality: A->B->C
  - It solved a lot of problems
  - Kant says that it's easy to account for C by showing B 
    - Prevents circular explanations -> where you assume what you are trying to show beforehand
    - Living systems don't follow this model -> tree is self-organizing
  - Feeback cycle -> cause circular explanation
- Hierraro
  - Dynamical system theory
    - Cause: **events** that make things happen -> ACTUALITY
    - Constraint: **condition** that make things possible. Structural functional organization -> POTENTIALITY
      - Enabling constraints: increases the possibility space -> virtual governor 
      - Selective constraints: decrease the possibility space -> virtual generator
    - Events cause the structure, the structure constraints the possibility of events
    - Virtual governor + virtual generator -> virtual engine (virtue)
    - Evolution
      - Feedback -> reproduction
      - Selective constraints -> scarcity of resources
      - Enabling constratins -> variation
- Character
  - Virtual engine of the person's development
  - Can be cultivated
    - Courage
      - Coward -> too few enabling constraints 
      - Foolhardy -> too few selecting constraints
- Purpose of living things -> structural-functional organization
