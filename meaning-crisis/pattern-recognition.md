# Pattern Recognition

- Unconscious pattern recognition -> grouping instances into categories by pattern, but they don't know how they are doing it or what pattern they are following
- Capacity outside of your conscious awareness to pick on complex patterns
- [[Intuition]]
- Two kinds of patterns:
  - Correlation patterns: A -> B ^ A -> C </=> B -> C
  - Causal patterns
