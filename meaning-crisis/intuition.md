# Intuition

- Result of implicit learning
- Learnt patterns unconsciously
- Prejudice is intuition gone wrong -> picked up on correlational patterns
- Performance gets worse when bringing everything to the unconscious -> we can't replace implicit learning with explicit learning
- Training: 
  - Set the correct context environment to implicitely learn the causal patterns
  - SAME CONDITIONS AS THE FLOW STATE
