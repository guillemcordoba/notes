# Plato

- First psycological theory
  - Different centers of gravity driving inner-conflict through self-deception
    - Man / head / reason                           -> truth-falsity, long tearm goals
    - Lion / chest / thymos                         -> Socio cultural, honor and shame, mid-term goals
    - Monster / stomach and genitals / appetite     -> Pleasure and pain, immediate goals, superficial
  - Across species
  - Cognitive science of this:
    - a stimulus loses salience the farther from the future it is because it becomes more and more improbable -> adaptive
    - You develop an analytical prefontal-cortex to counter it in just the right ways
  - The man can learn, the man can train the lion (socratic dialectic) and together the lion and the man can tame the monster
  - The more you harmonize these 3, you have less inner-conflict and more inner peace, and the more in touch with reality you become -> FEEDBACK LOOP
  - Participatory knowing -> change myself to see the world, that changes the world, which changes you
  - You can differentiate correlation patterns vs causality patterns
  - Myth of the cavern -> enlightentment, developmental story
  - How we understand something -> structural - functional organization, that make the whole greater than the sum of its parts
    - Logos, form
    - It's unconscious, the grasp is intuitive
    - How the thing is structured, and how you come to know it
