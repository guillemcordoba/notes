# Pre Axial Dark Age

- Most cities go extinct
- Most cultures disappear
- People go back to small communities
- Demand on cognition to adapt, as before the [[upper-paleolitic-transition]]
- They are willing to experiment with new forms of organizations
- They invent new types of [[psycotechnology]]
- Alphabetic literacy is invented in Palestine -> it's much easier to learn, a lot more people can learn it and more powerfully
  - Second order thinking
  - You can internalize the literacy in your [[metacognition]]
